	<em><h2>Artifact 1: Keith H. Design</h2></em>
	
<img src="KeithHaring.MG.png" width="324.5" height="432.5" alt="Break Dancing in NYC"/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: So for this project, I got inspiration from where Iâ€™m from NEW YORK CITY! And so, I decided to make my figures have fun dancing doing well known moves such as a headstand and a two-step.</p>
	
	
	
<em><h2>Artifact 2: Personal Logo</h2></em>
	
	<img src="PersonalLogos.MG.png" width="494" height="234" alt=""/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: My logo design is for a foodtruck business idea. My vision was that we serve easy to-go meals that can made in pan. This is why I incorporated the pan in the logo as the 'D' in delights. And MG is the initials of my name, Marieme Gueye.</p>
	
	
<em><h2>Artifact 3: Pop Gradient</h2></em>  
	
	<img src="PopArtGradients.MG.png" width="329" height="246.875" alt=""/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: The celebrity I did for this project is Sofia Carson. She is a well known American pop singer and an actress. For this I decided to very bright colors for the outline to compliment the mellow background.   </p>
	
	
<em><h2>Artifact 4: Activism Poster</h2></em>
	
	<img src="ActivismPoster.MG.png" width="300" height="400" alt=""/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: The issue I choose for my activism poster is Affordable House. I chose this because its a serious problem for many living in NYC. If inflation in pricings continue to rise, more people will be displaced with no where to go.</p>
	
	
	
<em><h2>Artifact 5: Transformation</h2></em>
	
	<img src="Transformations.MG.png" width="304" height="304" alt=""/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: The thanksgiving food I wanted to transform was mash potatoes. I tested out using different photo filters like hue, brightness, and saturation to edit the photo. By increasing the hue I was able to give it red-golden hue.</p>
	
	
<em><h2>Artifact 6: Tessellation</h2></em>
	
	<img src="Tessellations.png" width="399.5" height="385.5" alt=""/>
	
<p>Artist Statement: For my tessallation, I made a random shape that came to mind. When tilted sideways, it kinda looks like a person wearing earbuds.</p>
